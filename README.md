# Car-Acceptability

In this project we use machine learning to determine a classification model that predicts whether a car is in an "acceptable" or "unacceptable" condition based on different attributes of the car. As doing this manually can be time consuming.

For this project we determine the effectiveness of the model based on the accuracy of it (% of correct classifications). A decision tree model was the final model used in this project and resulted in an accuracy of 95.1%.

The car data set was collected from the UCI machine learning repository (and can be downloaded via https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/car/)
